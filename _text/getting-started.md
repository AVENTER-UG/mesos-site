<p>For a great introduction to building and running a distributed system with Apache Mesos, watch Benjamin Hindman's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTcZGODnyf0">talk on YouTube</a>. If anything could be considered <i>required reading</i>, it would be the official white paper: <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alig/papers/mesos.pdf">Mesos: A Platform for Fine-Grained Resource Sharing in the Data Center</a>.</p>
